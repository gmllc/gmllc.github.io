I&#39;m interested in what I call meta-development, which can be anything from the tools and routines to ideas that shape <a href="https://vimeo.com/34017777" class="blue" target="_blank">how we build things</a>. I love travelling, hiking, and exploring new things.</p>
<p>When I&#39;m not working, I like to learn about and play with compilers, operating systems, databases and distributed systems. I also enjoy a good bit of economics and politics, especially geopolitics and macro-economic issues. Right now I’m working towards an economics degree, and improving my cooking skills.</p></div></section><section id="services" class="news"><div class="container"><h2 class="section-title">Services</h2><p>I'm currently available to help with any type of project. I can help you to specify your problem and solve this problem in the most cost-effective way. If this involves writing custom code, I can select the right technologies, and design and implement the software that solves your problem. I strive to develop applications that are both efficient and user-friendly.</p><p>I have been involved in a couple of startups, and been part of the founding team for a few companies. So besides software development, I can also reason about business models and work out strategies for product, operations and growth.</p><ul><li class="service"><h3 class="service__title">Rapid Development:</h3><p class="service__description">My work experience have been quite different from each other so far in terms of technology stacks as well as company culture, size and field of business. This has helped me develop a broad set of skills and a good view on how things should and should not be done in different contexts. If you’re just starting out or you’ve got a project that's a little out of control, I can help you get it back on track.</p></li><li class="service"><h3 class="service__title">Performance:</h3><p class="service__description">I can do a full overhaul of your software and systems to tune-up the performance and reduce costs, by redesigning algorithms and tools for efficiency and improve the performance.</p></li><li class="service"><h3 class="service__title">Scalability:</h3><p class="service__description">Want advice on moving to a service oriented architecture? Considering refactoring a large, legacy codebase? Or maybe looking at switching database and looking for a second opinion, and help with the migration? I can help.</p></li><li class="service"><h3 class="service__title">Data Science:</h3><p class="service__description">I can extract knowledge, build systems, and automate processes.</p></li><li class="service"><h3 class="service__title">Blockchain integrations:</h3><p class="service__description">Different blockchains require different approaches; I figure them all out and abstract out their complexities so that you don't need to.</p></li></ul><p>My work is subject to the <a href="assets/playbook.pdf">General Magic terms and conditions</a>. They're pretty reasonable, though ;-)</p></div></section></main></body><footer class="footer"></footer><!--  .container--><script defer="defer" type="text/javascript">smoothScroll.init();</script></html>
