Hi there! I'm a software engineer currently based in New York. I'm interested in what I call meta-development, which can be anything from the tools and routines to ideas that shape <a href="https://vimeo.com/34017777" class="blue" target="_blank">how we build things</a>. 

When I can, I enjoy riding my bike, hiking, swimming and exploring new cities. I also enjoy a good bit of economics and politics, especially geopolitics and macro-economic issues. Right now Iâ€™m working towards an economics degree, and improving my design and cooking skills.
